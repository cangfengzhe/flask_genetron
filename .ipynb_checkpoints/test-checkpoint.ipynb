      " |      **Simple Relationship Joins**\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      Consider a mapping between two classes ``User`` and ``Address``,\n",
      " |      with a relationship ``User.addresses`` representing a collection\n",
      " |      of ``Address`` objects associated with each ``User``.   The most\n",
      " |      common usage of :meth:`~.Query.join` is to create a JOIN along this\n",
      " |      relationship, using the ``User.addresses`` attribute as an indicator\n",
      " |      for how this should occur::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          q = session.query(User).join(User.addresses)\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      Where above, the call to :meth:`~.Query.join` along ``User.addresses``\n",
      " |      will result in SQL equivalent to::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          SELECT user.* FROM user JOIN address ON user.id = address.user_id\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      In the above example we refer to ``User.addresses`` as passed to\n",
      " |      :meth:`~.Query.join` as the *on clause*, that is, it indicates\n",
      " |      how the \"ON\" portion of the JOIN should be constructed.  For a\n",
      " |      single-entity query such as the one above (i.e. we start by selecting\n",
      " |      only from ``User`` and nothing else), the relationship can also be\n",
      " |      specified by its string name::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          q = session.query(User).join(\"addresses\")\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      :meth:`~.Query.join` can also accommodate multiple\n",
      " |      \"on clause\" arguments to produce a chain of joins, such as below\n",
      " |      where a join across four related entities is constructed::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          q = session.query(User).join(\"orders\", \"items\", \"keywords\")\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      The above would be shorthand for three separate calls to\n",
      " |      :meth:`~.Query.join`, each using an explicit attribute to indicate\n",
      " |      the source entity::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          q = session.query(User).\\\n",
      " |                  join(User.orders).\\\n",

      " |      \n",
      " |      A second form of :meth:`~.Query.join` allows any mapped entity\n",
      " |      or core selectable construct as a target.   In this usage,\n",
      " |      :meth:`~.Query.join` will attempt\n",
      " |      to create a JOIN along the natural foreign key relationship between\n",
      " |      two entities::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          q = session.query(User).join(Address)\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      The above calling form of :meth:`~.Query.join` will raise an error if\n",
      " |      either there are no foreign keys between the two entities, or if\n",
      " |      there are multiple foreign key linkages between them.   In the\n",
      " |      above calling form, :meth:`~.Query.join` is called upon to\n",
      " |      create the \"on clause\" automatically for us.  The target can\n",
      " |      be any mapped entity or selectable, such as a :class:`.Table`::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          q = session.query(User).join(addresses_table)\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      **Joins to a Target with an ON Clause**\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      The third calling form allows both the target entity as well\n",
      " |      as the ON clause to be passed explicitly.   Suppose for\n",
      " |      example we wanted to join to ``Address`` twice, using\n",
      " |      an alias the second time.  We use :func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.aliased`\n",
      " |      to create a distinct alias of ``Address``, and join\n",
      " |      to it using the ``target, onclause`` form, so that the\n",
      " |      alias can be specified explicitly as the target along with\n",
      " |      the relationship to instruct how the ON clause should proceed::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          a_alias = aliased(Address)\n",
      " |      \n",

      " |                  join(User.addresses).\\\n",
      " |                  join(a_alias, User.addresses).\\\n",
      " |                  filter(Address.email_address=='ed@foo.com').\\\n",
      " |                  filter(a_alias.email_address=='ed@bar.com')\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      Where above, the generated SQL would be similar to::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          SELECT user.* FROM user\n",
      " |              JOIN address ON user.id = address.user_id\n",

      " |      \n",
      " |      The two-argument calling form of :meth:`~.Query.join`\n",
      " |      also allows us to construct arbitrary joins with SQL-oriented\n",
      " |      \"on clause\" expressions, not relying upon configured relationships\n",
      " |      at all.  Any SQL expression can be passed as the ON clause\n",
      " |      when using the two-argument form, which should refer to the target\n",
      " |      entity in some way as well as an applicable source entity::\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |          q = session.query(User).join(Address, User.id==Address.user_id)\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      .. versionchanged:: 0.7\n",
      " |          In SQLAlchemy 0.6 and earlier, the two argument form of\n",
      " |          :meth:`~.Query.join` requires the usage of a tuple:\n",
      " |          ``query(User).join((Address, User.id==Address.user_id))``\\ .\n",
      " |          This calling form is accepted in 0.7 and further, though\n",
      " |          is not necessary unless multiple join conditions are passed to\n",
      " |          a single :meth:`~.Query.join` call, which itself is also not\n",
